# Brightness-Simulation-through-Hand-Gesture

### The purpose of this code is to demonstrate the concept of mapping hand gestures to brightness control without actually implementing OS-specific brightness control.

This Python script demonstrates a simple implementation of hand tracking using MediaPipe to control a virtual screen brightness based on the distance between the thumb tip and the index finger tip.

Here's an explanation of the script:

1. The script imports necessary libraries including `cv2` for OpenCV and `mediapipe` for hand tracking.

2. MediaPipe hands module is initialized for hand tracking.

3. A function `map_hand_distance_to_brightness()` is defined to map the distance between the thumb tip and the index finger tip to a brightness value within a specified range.

4. A placeholder function `set_brightness()` is defined to simulate brightness changes. In a real implementation, this function would control the actual screen brightness. It is used to simulate brightness changes, printing the simulated brightness to the console.

5. Video capture is initialized from the default camera.

6. Within the main loop:
   - Frames are captured from the webcam and processed using MediaPipe hands.
   - Hand landmarks are detected, and the distance between the thumb tip and index finger tip is calculated.
   - The distance is mapped to a brightness value using the `map_hand_distance_to_brightness()` function.
   - The simulated brightness change is displayed as output in the console. This should be replaced with actual brightness control in a real implementation.
   - Hand landmarks are drawn on the frame for visualization.

7. The loop continues until the user exits by pressing the ESC key.

8. Finally, the script releases the video capture and closes all OpenCV windows.

This script provides a basic framework for implementing hand gesture-based control systems, such as controlling screen brightness, volume, or any other parameter that can be adjusted based on hand gestures.
